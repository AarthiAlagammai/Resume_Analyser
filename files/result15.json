In this,n the categorized input is further grouped into then application.n 5 Recommendation system based on The two algorithms such as KNN and sparse SVDn the collaborative filtering are used to build the recommendation system forn the book dataset. The comparative analysis ofn KNN and SVD algorithms are done.n 6 Sequence to sequence model for The sequence to sequence model is used for then spell check spelling correction.
